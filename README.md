# CrimeCategoryPrediction

The CrimeCategoryPrediction project uses data from the Toronto Police of Ontario, Canada, which includes information about major crime indicators (MCI) such as the date and time of the crime, and its location. The goal of this project is to predict the category of crime based on this information.

The categories of crime include Assault, Break and Enter, Theft Over, Robbery, and Auto Theft. The model uses data about the neighborhood, date and time of occurrence, premises type, and other relevant details to make its predictions.

This is an initial version of the model, and there is room for improvement. 
While working on this project, I have learned 
- how to encode categorical labels 
- how to handle mixed features that include both numerical and categorical data types
- how to balance your data when your have categorical labels
